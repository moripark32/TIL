Lifecycle of Components :
Each component in React has a lifecycle
which you can monitor and manipulate during its three main phases.

render : 
The render() method is required, and is the method that actually outputs the HTML to the DOM.

constructor:
-The constructor() method is called before anything else, when the component is initiated, 
and it is the natural place to set up the initial state and other initial values.

-The constructor() method is called with the props, as arguments, 
and you should always start by calling the super(props) before anything else, this will initiate 
the parent's constructor method and allows the component to inherit methods from its parent

componentDidMount:
The componentDidMount() method is called after the component is rendered.
This is where you run statements that requires that the component is already placed in the DOM.

componentDidUpdate:
The componentDidUpdate method is called after the component is updated in the DOM.

1. 부모 constructor를 읽어들인다.
2. 부모를 render하고 부모 렌더안에 있는 자식 컴포넌트를 읽는다
3. 자식 컴포넌트내의 constructor를 읽는다.
4. 자식을 render하고 componentdidmount내의 코드까지 읽고 부모 컴포넌트로 돌아간다.
5. 부모 componentdidmount를 읽어들인다
6. 부모comonentdidmount안에서 fetch를 하고 
   (안에서 setState-> update -> render)
7. 부모 render안에 있는 자식 컴포넌트로 넘어간다.
8. 자식 render한다.
